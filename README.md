# Data-Structure-Algorithms

Welcome to the **Data-Structure-Algorithms** repository, where we dive deep into the world of computer science to solve and contribute solutions to LeetCode problems. Our goal is to not only tackle these challenging puzzles but to also implement various data structures from scratch, adding unique twists to well-known algorithms along the way.

Please note that our repository features an eclectic collection of solutions and implementations, some of which may only be supported by a select few programming languages.

## Language Support

- **Python 3** - Our primary language for solutions and implementations.
- **Java** - Coming Soon! We look forward to expanding our repository to include Java solutions.
- **C++** - Coming Soon! C++ offers great performance, and we are excited about integrating it into our codebase.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from fellow coding enthusiasts and problem-solvers. If you have a solution to a LeetCode problem or an interesting data structure or algorithm implementation, feel free to submit a pull request. Here are some guidelines to follow:

- For new solutions, please create a subdirectory within the corresponding language folder that matches the LeetCode problem title or number.
- Include a README within your subdirectory providing a brief description of the problem and the approach taken in your solution.
- Ensure your code is well-commented, follows language-specific best practices, and includes basic tests or examples demonstrating its correctness.
- Update the main README (this file) with the list of problems solved if necessary.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you may clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Data-Structure-Algorithms.git
```
Make sure that you have the prerequisite software installed on your computer, including Python 3, and any upcoming language support mentioned in the Language Support section.
Solutions Directory Structure

Our solutions are organized within language-specific directories. Here's an overview of the current structure:

    /Python - All Python solutions are placed in this directory.
    /Java - (Coming Soon) Java solutions will reside here.
    /C++ - (Coming Soon) Look for C++ solutions here.

Each directory contains subdirectories for specific problems, which in turn include the problem's solution code and an accompanying README.
